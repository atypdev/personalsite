# atypdev/personalsite

Operates as my personal website, has a blog and serves to document my projects.

It deploys using Netlify, which builds every time a commit gets pushed to this GitHub.

You can view it at [https://atyp.dev](https://atyp.dev)!

### TODO:
- [x] Prevent edits to README.md and other innocuous files from triggering Netlify builds
- [ ] Keep on writing!
