## Proxmox-based Homelab Server
{: .text-center}

(and my current pride and joy <3)
{: .text-center}

This system is my self-hosting not-so-powerhouse. I use it to run light VMs, containers and to store my media collection.

There are plenty of plans to upgrade, but that's in the distant future when I have enough disposable income (fairly difficult as a full-time student)!
